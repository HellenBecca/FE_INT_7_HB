    <p>My HW</p>
    <p>As part of this homework, I have learned how to set up a Git repository,<br>
        as well as use commit, push (from local to remote), and pull (from remote to local).<br>
        Additionally, I have gained insight into how deploying can be used to publish updates<br>
        and changes to a live environment, making the project accessible to users.</p>
