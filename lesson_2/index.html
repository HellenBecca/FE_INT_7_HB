    <p>My HW</p>
    <p>
        As part of this lesson's homework, I have installed two extensions in Visual Studio Code: 
        Live Server and Auto Save. These extensions help streamline the development process by 
        automatically saving changes and instantly previewing them in a browser. <br><br>
        Live Server allows me to view real-time updates as I code, while Auto Save ensures that all 
        changes are saved automatically, reducing the risk of losing progress.
